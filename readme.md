# SPICYPHYSICS
### A (barely almost) comprehensive physics notes repository 
If you found this, I might have sent a link to you somewhere, or placed it somewhere on the web, or you simply found it in unknown ways. But anyway, here you are.
I personally curated all the notes here during my Bachelor's degree in physics, disregarding traditional course divisions for pure egotistical comfort and aesthetic pleasure, but you can rebuild it yourself by using the sources published, since all chapters (of most notes (!!)) are singular .tex files.
Soon I will update the notes (and add new ones!) since I'm furthering my studies in physics with a Master's degree in Atmospheric Physics, Meteorology and Climatology, therefore it *will* become a fluid-dynamics centered repository. 
I'll do my best, if you find errors or have any inquiries hmu at [chemistryisforlosers@gmail.com](mailto:chemistryisforlosers@gmail.com)
